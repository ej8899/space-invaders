# space-invaders
space invaders type game in JS


Turns out this era of Global Boiling that we're all in together is the martians trying to terraform earth into something livable for them. So much for getting along with our neighbors, eh?!?

Shoot down the falling alien terraformers to save earth from the impending climate (& alien) disaster.


## Todo:
- turn blocks to sprites
- aliens to explode when hit
- sounds
- reset on game over
- high score save to localstorage
- improve scoring -> kills confirmed
- improve scoring -> player health if hit
- improve scoring -> earth status (if aliens get past)



## Notes to Self:
Just playing around with game dev in JS (& Python, but obviously this is JS related)... scribbled this up in Code Pen, but it's turning into a bit more than just what I want to work on there... so, thought it could use it's own project.
